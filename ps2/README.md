# doomgeneric — PlayStation 2 port (technical)

A PS2 port of [doomgeneric](https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric) built on the
[ps2dev](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev) SDL2 toolchain. This document covers
the PS2-specific design; for an overview and build presets see the
[top-level README](../README.md).

## Design: upstream stays pristine

The upstream sources in `../doomgeneric` are kept **unmodified** so syncing with
ozkl stays trivial. All PS2 code lives here in `ps2/`. A couple of upstream files
are *replaced* (compiled from here instead of upstream), and there are only a few
small `#ifdef __PS2__` hooks in upstream core files (IWAD selection, music-module
selection, an audio-backend printf).

## Audio architecture

```
                EE                                  IOP / SPU2
  ┌───────────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
  SFX  ─ i_audsrvsound.c ─ mix ─┐       │  audsrv.irx + libsd.irx           │
                                ├─ RPC ─┤  → SPU2 PCM streaming source      │

                                        │                                   │
  SPU2 music ─ i_spu2music.c ─── RPC ───┤  spusynth.irx                     │
  (flatten MIDI → events)               │  → 20 hardware ADPCM voices       │
                                        └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **SFX** are always mixed on the EE and streamed to the SPU2's one PCM source
  via audsrv.
- **Music** has two interchangeable `music_module_t` backends, chosen at build
  time in `i_sound.c`:
  - **OPL/FM** (`i_oplmusic.c` + `opl*.c` + `dbopl.c`) — default. Renders AdLib
    FM from the IWAD's GENMIDI lump into the audsrv stream.
  - **SPU2 hardware-voice synth** (`i_spu2music.c` + `iop/spusynth/`) — built
    with `SPU_MUSIC=1`. Drives the chip's own ADPCM voices (see below).

### SPU2 hardware-voice synth

The EE side (`i_spu2music.c`) loads `spusynth.irx`, parses the song with
`midifile.c` (MUS → MIDI via `mus2mid`, all in memory), flattens every track in
absolute-tick order with tempo applied into `(delay_us, cmd, chan, note, vel)`
events (`spusynth_rpc.h`), and ships them to the IOP in batches over **SIF RPC**.

The IOP side (`iop/spusynth/spusynth.c`) runs a sequencer thread that plays the
event stream with `DelayThread` timing onto a pool of 20 Core-1 voices
(note→voice map, oldest-steal when full). It synthesises a small ADPCM
**waveform bank** (square / saw / triangle / sine / pulse + white-noise) into SPU
RAM at boot, and a GM-family **patch map** maps each channel's current program to
a waveform + ADSR; channel 9 plays the noise sample as percussion at a fixed
per-drum pitch.

Hard-won SPU2 facts (see the long-form notes in the source):
- Key voices on **Core 1** — audsrv makes it the live DAC core and zeroes
  Core 0's master volume.
- Open the **`MMIX` voice-dry gates** (`SndL|SndR = 0xC00`) on Core 1; bits 0–7
  are input gates only.
- `sceSdVoiceTrans` uses the **pointer value** of its `spuaddr` arg as the SPU
  byte address (no dereference), and the IO path casts it to `u16` — so pass
  `(u32*)0x5000`, not `&var`, and keep it < 64 KB.
- SPU2 volume registers are 15-bit signed: **`0x3FFF` is max** (`0x7FFF` reads
  negative → silence).
- We piggyback on audsrv (which powers the chip up); a standalone libsd/libspu2
  driver stays silent under this setup.

## Boot

`main()` (in `doomgeneric_ps2.c`) brings up the libdebug GS text console
(`ps2_bootscr.c`) for the boot log, holds it ~3 s, then SDL takes the GS for the
game framebuffer.

**The ~28 s boot stall** was *not* libdebug, cdfs, or audio — it was
libps2_drivers' `waitUntilDeviceIsReady` (called by SDL2main's `main` before
ours): with an embedded/host: WAD the device it polls never reports ready, so it
spun out a long timeout (PCSX2 flagged the EE loop at `0x205FC0`, inside that
function). `ps2_drivers_stub.c` overrides it (and stubs the unused USB/dev9
drivers). Boot now reaches audio in ~3.8 s instead of ~33 s.

## Building

Needs the `ps2dev` toolchain (`$PS2SDK`, `$GSKIT`). Easiest via the repo's
`build.sh` (see the [top-level README](../README.md)); raw `make` also works:

```sh
docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v <repo>:/work -w /work/ps2 ps2dock:local \
  make [EMBED_WAD=1] [SPU_MUSIC=1] [GSKIT_VIDEO=1 GS480P=1]
```

- `EMBED_WAD=1` bakes in `DOOM1.WAD` (must be present in `ps2/`).
- `SPU_MUSIC=1` selects the SPU2 hardware-voice synth instead of OPL music and
  compiles `i_spu2music.o` + the `spusynth.irx` (built via `iop/spusynth/`).
- `audsrv.irx` / `libsd.irx` are copied from the SDK automatically.

## Running (PCSX2 or hardware)

Load `doomgeneric.elf` (or boot the ISO). The boot log shows for ~3 s, then the
game/demo loop starts.

- **WADs**: the WAD is found on cdfs (disc/ISO, as `DOOM.WAD`), on hostfs
  (`host:` next to the ELF), or the embedded shareware copy. Several found →
  controller menu.
- **Sound**: SFX via audsrv. Music via OPL/FM (default) or the SPU2 synth
  (`SPU_MUSIC=1`) — both play the IWAD's MUS/MIDI music.

## Copyright / WADs

Doom WADs are **not** part of this repository (`*.wad` is git-ignored). The
shareware `DOOM1.WAD` is freely redistributable; `DOOM.WAD`, `DOOM2.WAD`, etc.
are commercial — do not commit, embed for distribution, or share them. The
default build embeds nothing, so the distributable ELF contains no game data.
